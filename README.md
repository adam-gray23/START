# START

START was developed as a learning tool for new programmers to begin their
programming journey. It is a simple, easy to use, and easy to learn language,
developed by ourselves, Niall Kelly and Adam Gray, for our third year project in Dublin
City University.

## Introduction

### What is START?

As previously mentioned, START is a simple, easy to use, and easy to learn, meaning
we aimed to make it so a first time programmer could pick up the language and within
a very short space of time, be able to fully use all of START's features.

START was developed using Java, and was intended to be run on Windows, however,
it can indeed be run on other operating systems, such as Linux and MacOS,
however, you will need toconfigure START onto your machines PATH, and
create your own start1 file to run the programs.

### Why START?

Why, or more appropriately, when should someone use START? Well, START is a great for
someone with no programming experience, or someone who has a little experience with a visual
programming language such as Scratch. It is also a great language for someone who wants to
further their problem solving skills, and learn how to think like a programmer.

### How to use START?

For a more indepth look at how to use START, please refer to the user manual, which can
be found in this repository, as well as the cheat sheet, which can be found here also.

These include instructions on how to use START's features, along with some example snippets
of code to get you started.

# Running a START program

Once you have installed START, you can now run a START program. To do this, you will need to create a file with the extension .st. This file will contain the code for your program. To run this program, you will need to open a command prompt or powershell terminal and navigate to the directory where your .st file is located. Once you are in the correct directory, you can run your program by typing the following command:

    start1 <filename>.st

Where "filename" is the name of your .st file.
